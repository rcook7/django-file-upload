Django dropzone upload
======================

Example project for integrating [Dropzone.js](http://www.dropzonejs.com) with
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

Introduction
------------

[Dropzone.js](http://www.dropzonejs.com) by [Matias
Meno](https://github.com/enyo) is a javascript library for drag and drop file
uploading. It is very light and simple to configure and extend. This example uses ImageField, but you can easily change that to using FileField instead.

I have earlier created
[django-jquery-file-upload](https://github.com/sigurdga/django-jquery-file-upload),
which integrates [jquery-file-upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jquery-file-upload) by
[Sebastian Tschan](https://github.com/blueimp) with Django. That project has a
lot of functionality and tries to be a complete package of all you need. It also works on older browsers.

Django-dropzone-upload tries to be as minimal and simple to understand as
possible, as it should be fairly easy to with Dropzone.js functionality.

Howto
-----

We assume you have git, python and python-virtualenv already installed.

* Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/sigurdga/django-dropzone-upload.git
* Change directory: cd django-dropzone-upload
* Create virtualenv: virtualenv venv
* Activate virtualenv: source venv/bin/activate
* Install dependencies into virtualenv: pip install -r requirements.txt
* Setup database: python manage.py syncdb
* Run development server: python manage.py runserver
* Open browser at localhost:8000

Limitations
-----------

Dropzone.js claims to work for modern browsers:

* Chrome 7+
* Firefox 4+
* IE 10+
* Opera 12+ (Version 12 for MacOS is disabled because their API is buggy)
* Safari 6+

Django-dropzone-upload does not try to do anything more than Dropzone in
its simplest form, so no delete, no listing of already uploaded, etc. in this
project.
